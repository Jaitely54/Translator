# Speech Translation System

This Python script allows users to translate spoken sentences from one language to another using the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and Translation APIs. The translated text is then converted into speech and played back to the user.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- The required Python packages: `speech_recognition`, `googletrans`, and `gtts`.

You can install the required packages using pip:


## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:


2. Follow the on-screen instructions:
   - Speak 'hello' to initiate the translation.
   - Speak a sentence in English.
   - The script will translate the sentence to Hindi and play back the translated speech.

## Configuration

- You can change the source and target languages in the script by modifying the `from_lang` and `to_lang` variables in the `translate_speech()` function.
- Adjustments to the microphone sensitivity and ambient noise suppression can be made by changing the parameters in the `adjust_for_ambient_noise()` function.
